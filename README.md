ExtensibleCalculator
====================

What is it?
-----------
`ExtensibleCalculator` is a calculator!!! and that is it! But what does it exactly calculate? Well, the answer is...
I do not know :( ... at the moment. However, it could potentially calculate pretty much anything that you, me, we, they want!

`ExtensibleCalculator` is a simple and extensible web-style API based on a custom framework used to dinamically 
load `CalculatorService` implementations. `CalculatorService` implementations contain the actual logic to perform 
operations and are meant to be implemented by users.

The `ExtensibleCalculator` enables users to:
- Load jar files at runtime, 
- Load custom `CalculatorService` implementations from previously loded jars and,
- Perform operations using the available `CalculatorService` implementations
